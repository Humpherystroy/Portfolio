      <h2>Professional Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Ive been in the warehouse industry since straight out of highschool, I
        eventually became a team lead and trainer. Ive always do my best no
        matter the situation and if I stuggle with something I just keep working
        on it to get better and better. I like to set personal goals each day
        for work and I always excel to hit those goals, even if involves staying
        late to get it done.
